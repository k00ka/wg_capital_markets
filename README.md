# Content for the Blockchain Canada Capital Markets Working Group

This wiki contains a living document.  
This document is a working group paper that is to be included in the Blockchain Canada report to the Government of Canada.  
The wiki is divided into "chapters", each of which is manifested as an editable page.  
To contribute to the document you should send a note to @k00ka requesting "edit" access to the repository.
